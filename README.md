# IntelliDose - your intelligent pill companion

This semester we have IoT device design for PBL, so I decided to create a webpage presenting the idea we are working on. In the future, it is planned to add at least two new pages: the first is a list of offered products/models, the second is a page with a contact form (navbar items are already added but currently redirect at the top of the landing page).

## Link

## Responsiveness

* The webpage supports both mobile and desktop devices.<br>
* The desktop version <b>responds adequatelly to changes in browser window size</b>.<br>
* In mobile version elements that were arranged in a row, <b>rearrange themselves in columns</b>.<br>
* In mobile version sliding header that by click allows users to jump at the top of the page is <b>replaced with a button in the bottom-left corner</b>.

## Mascot

* For the desktop version, a mascot character was added in the bottom-left corner. And I mean it, you won't find it in the mobile version. I've hid it on purpose, because I think it is unsuitable element in the context of mobile web-design. If it is necessary for him to be there, I'll add it in the future versions.
* It appears on the screen in its entirety after a certain period of time, follows the user as they scroll, and displays a welcome message when hovering over it.
